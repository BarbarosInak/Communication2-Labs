# Communication2-Labs
This repository shows the codes that I have written in the second communication lecture, which was given at IZTECH Electronics and Communication Engineering. 

-LAB 1-
-------

Downsampling's effects on have been investigated by applying different interpolation techniques and plotting signals. In the second part, the quantization operation applied and plotted the quantized versions of the message signal. In the end, by using MSE and SQNR values the difference between the original signal and the quantized signal has been observed.

-LAB 2-
-------

Delta modulation has been applied with different delta values. Finally, the effect of the different delta values has been investigated by looking at MSE and P values.

-LAB 3-
-------

In lab 3, we observed the noisy channel's effect on the signal and calculated the probability error.

-LAB 4-
-------

We investigated the roll-of factor's effect while getting rid of ISI effects.

-LAB 5-
-------

BASK, BFSK, and BPSK simulations have been done in the final lab.
